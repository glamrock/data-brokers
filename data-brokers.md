# Credit Reporting Agencies

There’s not a good way to fully opt-out of credit reporting. Get a free annual
credit report via annualcreditreport.com if you have a social security number
or tax ID number. I highly recommend requesting via snail mail and
requesting that errors be removed. You can also opt-out of pre-approved
credit card & loan offers, which is a common vector for identity theft.

# Online Marketing

Digital marketing firms also conduct monitoring and correlation of user
data. This is most noticeable with “retargeting,” the phenomena where
ads seem to follow you around the internet. Opting out won’t keep ads
from displaying, but helps limit retargeting and self-reinforcing ad
cycles.

> `Advertiser 1`: You looked at dog food yesterday, so you *must* have a
dog, right? We’ll show you more ads about dog food so maybe you’ll buy
*our* dog food next time.<br><br>
`Advertiser 2`: Because you’re seeing lots of ads about dogfood, you must
have a dog, right?
